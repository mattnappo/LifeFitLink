    About us:
    <br>
    What's the hardest part of working out? <u><b>Motivation</b></u>. As said by Zig Ziglar, an American author, "People often say that motivation doesn't last. Well, neither does bathing - that's why we recommend it daily."
    That is why the Masters Computer Science Team developed LifeFitLink.
    The app makes it simple to find the nearest gym within a 3 mile radius which allows the user to plan and set up times for meeting and working out.
    The built in "Find Friends" feature, the crux of the app, gives the client a profile database of people within their area, and allows the user to collaborate with different people while they exercise.
    Simply download, sign up, and search to find people to work out with at a gym near you.
